Description: Provides `ggplot2` framework for visualising distributions that are 
designed for displaying Highest Density Regions (HDR). 
This work is based on the package ['hdrcde'](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/hdrcde/)
<doi:10.2307/2684423> and displays highest density regions in one and two dimensions
and univariate densities conditional on one covariate.
