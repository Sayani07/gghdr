This was how being a newcomer to [rOpenSci OzUnconf 2019](https://ozunconf19.ropensci.org/) felt. It is incredible to be a part of such a diverse, welcoming and inclusive environment. In this blog, it would be fun to cover how we all came together to create this project and the twists and turns along the way. If you want to know how `gghdr` works, please visit [the package website](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/gghdr/) or learn more about it on [Github](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/gghdr/).


# Initiation

Initially, the aim was to visualize _Highest Density Regions_ (HDR) in one and two dimensions under the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) framework. HDRs are useful in displaying multimodality in the distribution. This work is inspired by the package [hdrcde](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hdrcde/index.html) developed by [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/). Since the [paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2684423?seq=1) was written almost 20 years ago and the package came 12 years ago, the need to relook it under the ggplot2 lenses had been lurking around for a while. While I read the paper and attempted using hdrcde a year back, it did feel less powerful not being able to use ggplot and the flexibilities that come along with it, not forgetting that there was a point when [Mitch](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/) had been threatening me that he would get this done overnight if I don’t. (I bet he would have had he not been raising chickens and bees). So one fine day he suggested that rOpensci could be the right place to do this together and I thought this was a brilliant idea as I had read about [Nick's](https://www.njtierney.com/) [experience](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/31/ozunconf2017/) earlier and was thrilled to be a part of it. Thanks to the organizers of rOpenSci for the opportunity and excellent management of what has turned out to be a highly stimulating experience. 

# Planning and execution

Shortly after we got to know we are a part of rOpenSci 2019, Mitch posted the idea on the [rOpenSci Github issues page](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf19/issues). This is a great place to start a discussion on a rough idea or to learn more or comment on any idea that you find exciting. We brainstormed for a couple of days on how [`hdrcde`](https://github.com/robjhyndman/hdrcde) worked and what are the potential functions and features we would like to have or improve in the new package. The discussion led to a workflow which pretty much looked like this: 


```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("/man/figures/board.jpg"))
```

Although rOpenSci strongly encourages to work on projects that you thought of even on that very day, doing a bit of brainstorming on the project helped us to set the expectations right and communicate that to the onboarding team members. 

Fast-forward to the first day of the conference! The participants had already suggested ideas (there were many brilliant ones - found [here](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf19/issues)) and then voting started for the projects people were excited to be associated with. Little did we know that time there would be five more enthusiasts ([Stephen Pearce](https://github.com/sparce), [Ryo Nakagawara](https://github.com/Ryo-N7), [Darya Vanichkina](https://github.com/dvanic), [Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org/) and [Thomas Fung](https://github.com/thomas-fung)) who would be as eager to contribute to this project and learn about ggplot2 internals (very aptly put by Mitch while advertising the project. Smart move mate)! Oh and what a fun and collaborative team to work with! See how they won’t stop coding:

At the end of the two days, we had established the following:

1. `geom_hdr_boxplot()` to replace `hdr.boxplot()` to calculate HDR boxplots in one dimension.

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
__Before:__
```{r hdrcde-boxplot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(hdrcde)
hdr.boxplot(faithful$eruptions) 
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
__After:__
```{r gghdr-boxplot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gghdr)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(faithful, aes(y = eruptions)) +
  geom_hdr_boxplot() 
```
</div>
</div>

2. The interval bars in `hdr.den()` to be replaced with a rug plot to display HDRs of 1d marginal distributions in `geom_hdr_rug()`. `geom_density()` could then be added to the resultant plot to get plots equivalent to `hdr.den()`.
 
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
__Before:__
```{r hdrcde-den, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(hdrcde)
hdr.den(faithful$eruptions,
        col = c("skyblue", "slateblue2", "slateblue4"))
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
__After:__
```{r gghdr-den, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gghdr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
faithful %>% ggplot(aes(x = eruptions)) +
  geom_density(n= 1001, bw = hdrcde::hdrbw(faithful$eruptions, mean(c(0.5, 0.95, 0.99)))) +
  geom_hdr_rug(fill=  "blue") + 
  xlim(c(0.6833018, 6.0166982))
```
</div>
</div>

Also, the display of 1d marginal distributions for both variables could be a useful feature to have.

```{r}
ggplot(faithful, aes(y = eruptions, x = waiting)) + 
  geom_hdr_rug(sides = "trbl", fill = "blue") + 
  geom_point()
```

3. `hdr_bin()` to replace `hdrscatterplot()`. This would not be an independent geom, but rather a function to add in the aesthetic color with each color representing an HDR with a specified coverage.

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
__Before:__
```{r hdrcde-scatterplot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hdrscatterplot(faithful$waiting,
               faithful$eruptions)
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
__After:__
```{r gghdr-scatterplot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = faithful, 
       aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = hdr_bin(x = waiting,
                                  y = eruptions)))
```
</div>
</div>


4. `geom_hdrcde_boxplot()` to replace `hdr.cde()` which is used in HDRs for a conditional density estimate.

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
__Before:__
```{r hdrcde-cde, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
faithful.cde <- cde(faithful$waiting, faithful$eruptions)
plot(faithful.cde, plot.fn = "hdr",
     xlab = "Waiting time", ylab = "Duration time")
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
__After:__
```{r gghdr-cde, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) + 
    geom_hdr_boxplot(fill="steelblue") + 
    theme_minimal()
```
</div>
</div>

5. We also deliberated on names of potential functions at the brainstorming stage which led to the idea of a [package design collaboration corner](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf19/issues/19). 

6. Documentation, testing and illustrative followed along the way to make it CRAN ready.


# Bottlenecks along the way

- Now where there's a will, there's a way. Except that soon we could say where there is a merge, there is a conflict.  While most times we use Github for code-sharing, publishing software and collaborating with our future self, this was the time to show how we collaborate with others. It took almost 2 hours, GitKraken and Mitch to get us out of the merge conflicts.

- Extending ggplot2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/extending-ggplot2.html). __(Writing about the scale problem that was faced.)__


# Where to from here?

A missing piece is to replace the `hdr.boxplot.2d()` with `geom_hdr_boxplot.2d()`  which would calculate and plot HDRs in two dimensions. Nevertheless, we have the raw materials for an R package. All we need is some embellishment and (lots of) review to get it on CRAN. Kudos team!!

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("/man/figures/team.jpg"))
```
